# 🚀 Welcome to your first small web project!

This mini-website is designed to help you reflect on your personal goals for your apprenticeship while also giving you a chance to practice the basics of web development using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS.

## ⚠️ How To

- your markup file is -> `index.html`
- for new styles and scripts -> use the `src` folder
- if you want to use custom icons, fonts or images -> add a new folder in the `src folder``
- if you want to use custom tailwind classes -> customize `tailwind.config.js`
- the `dist`folder only contains compiled files -> when you're done working, use ```yarn build``` to compile your files (don't work in the `dist`folder!)

---

## 🎯 Your Task

Create a **personal website** that includes the following:

- Who are you?
- Why did you choose this apprenticeship?
- What do you expect from the training?
- What are your hopes and wishes?
- What do you want to achieve?

---

## 🎨 Be Creative – this is YOUR project:

### for example:
- Use **Tailwind CSS** or your own styles
- Add **images, icons, or colors** to make it personal
- Build a layout that is clear, modern, and visually appealing

Enjoy and have fun building your site! 🚀
